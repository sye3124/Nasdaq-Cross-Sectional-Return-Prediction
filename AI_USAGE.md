# Use of AI Tools

This project made use of AI-assisted tools, including ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, to support the development and documentation process. These tools were used exclusively as aids to improve efficiency and clarity during implementation and writing.

Specifically, AI tools were used for the following purposes:

- Writing coherent comments and docstrings for code documentation
- Debugging assistance and clarification of error messages
- Support in the creation and structuring of unit tests
- Guidance on designing the overall project workflow and modular code architecture
- Assistance with the structural organization and drafting of the written report
